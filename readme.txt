== Installation ==

1. Upload the full directory into your wp-content/plugins directory
2. Use your favourite FTP program to create two files in your WordPress directory (that's where the wp-config.php is) named sitemap.xml and sitemap.xml.gz and make them writable via CHMOD 666. More information about CHMOD and how to make files writeable is available at the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions) and on [stadtaus.com](http://www.stadtaus.com/en/tutorials/chmod-ftp-file-permissions.php). Making your whole blog directory writeable is NOT recommended any-more due to security reasons.
4. Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page
5. Go to the plugins administration screen in your WordPress admin and activate the plugin.
6. Go to the plugins administration screen in your WordPress admin, click on Add New, search for Simple Map and click on Install Now.
